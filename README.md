# CVFormatter
Input a CV doc file, and have it output the doc into a preset format

Specifically tailored for a previous company I was hired for that required manual formatting of CV's into a designated CV template.

Utilises GUI and a mix of automated/manual process to increase productivity.

Goal: To completely automate the CV formatting process
